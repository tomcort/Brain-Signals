    fs_welch: Sampling (domain) frecuency of power spectral density. Default 20.

    f: Real array (n,) of frecuency domain where n its the number
    of windows generate by Hanh method and the values are between 0 and fs/2.

    coherency: Complex array (nRows, nRows, n). The element coherency[i,j,k] is the of coherency
    between the i signal and j signal evaluated in the frecuency Tf[k]. 

    Tf: Only if points_interval != 0. Real array (n,) of frecuency domain where n its the number
    of windows generate by Hanh method and the values are between 0 and fs/2.

    Tcoherency: Only if points_interval != 0. Complex array (nRows, nRows, n, n_interval) where 
    n_interval = nColumns/points_interval. The element Tcoherency[i,j,k,z] is the of coherency
